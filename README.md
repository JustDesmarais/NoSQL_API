# Social Media API

## Description

This Social Media API uses a NoSQL architecture to create, read, update, and delete Users, Thoughts, and Reactions. The models are built using Mongoose and the router is handled by Express.js.  It is a simple yet effective way to organize users and their posts for the social media build of any up-and-coming start-up!

## Installation <a id="Installation"></a>

Installation is as easy as downloading this repository, run npm install in the root folder of the terminal, and then running npm start to initiate the server and connect the API to the database.  From there you can link up to whatever front-end elements that will utilize the API or test in Insomnia or Postman
